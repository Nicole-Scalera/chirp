Welcome to my experimental GitHub repository, Chirp.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to act as a sandbox for git-related experiments. Everytime I work on a new project, I always learn something new. Since I'm self-taught, I frequently refer to concepts and practices from other resources, such as the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.

I *pull* inspiration (no pun intended) from these sources to advance my version control skillset. However, to preserve the integrity of my other repos, I created this one to use as practice. I will continue to write detailed descriptions in my commits and document my journey.

### Inspiration
I named this repository after my favorite [music disc](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Music_disc) in Minecraft, "[chirp](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Music_Disc_chirp)". It is also a song featured on [Minecraft - Volume Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft_%E2%80%93_Volume_Beta) (2013) by [C418](https://c418.org/).

Like many others, Minecraft was more than a cultural touchstone of my childhood. It became a catalyst in my creativity, a place where I was free to design and build and breakdown and reconstruct ideas without limits. GitHub has allowed me to continue a very similar practice into my adulthood; only this time, I'm *making* the game.
